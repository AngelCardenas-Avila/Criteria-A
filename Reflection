TWS: China has a problem with banning and censoring most websites from other places. Not all of them are bad but China still disprove and dislike them so they continue to ban them resulting i n their online experience being completely different from the rest of the world's. One solution to this is creating a Chinese friendly website explaining this and providing amazing websites that will enhance their online experience. Maybe after that they wont ban so many websites.

TWS: For primary sources, certain quotes from certain people talking about what an amazing tool the internet is thanks to the the wide variety of websites created by people. Secondary sources can be websites that we know they like or positively will like.

TWS: Easy solutions for this problem are VPNs or other search engines like Tor. DNS Servers are also an option. These options help people get around firewalls or blocks while also keeping you anonymous.

TWS: My website will display various methods for the Chinese to get around the online firewall in their country. This will allow them to explore and view the great tools and websites that they miss out thanks to their government. This may help them realize how much their government is holding them back from something that should not be restricted.
